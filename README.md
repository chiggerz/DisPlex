# DisPlex
!WORK IN PROGRESS!

I am by no means a developer and have very limited knowledge of coding, but with the help of ChatGPT I have managed to put this together so far.  Learning as I go! Tried a few bots over the years with great features, so thought i'd try and develop one myself to do exactly what I want. 

Main feaatures I am hoping to achieve:
- Link plex user with discord user
- Unlink users
- Add expire dates 
- View full list of all users on Plex servers, including:
    - Plex username
    - Plex email address
    - Discord mention
    - Expire date
- Unlink users
- Export discord users on Discord server with discord IDs
- Help; showing all available bot commands 

Ideas to add (if possible):
- Share/Unshare libraries with plex users
- Update Tautulli friendly name with Discord display name
- Update Overseerr user Discord User ID & Display Name
- Send notification when expire date upcoming or passed

Feel free to get in touch if you want to assist with the creation :-)
