# DisPlex
!WORK IN PROGRESS!

I am by no means a developer and have very limited knowledge of coding, but with the help of ChatGPT I have managed to put this together so far.  Learning as I go! Tried a few bots over the years with great features, so thought i'd try and develop one myself to do exactly what I want. 

Main features:
- Link plex user with discord user 
- Invite to Plex server 
- Add expire dates 
- View full list of all users on Plex server
- Unlink users

Ideas to add (if possible):
- Update Tautulli friendly name with Discord display name
- Update Overseerr Discord User ID & Display Name

Feel free to get in touch if you want to assist with the creation :-)
